1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Answer:  
In the schema, the "Product_Category" entity likely represents a classification or grouping system for products. This could be used to categorize products based on common characteristics or attributes.
The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities indicates that each product is associated with a specific category. This implies a one-to-many relationship, where each product belongs to one category, but a category can have multiple products associated with it.
To implement this relationship, there is likely a foreign key column in the "Product" table, such as "category_id", which references the primary key column in the "Product_Category" table. This establishes the connection between products and their respective categories, allowing for efficient organization and retrieval of product information based on category criteria.



2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Answer:
   To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it is by implementing data validation rules within application or database management system. 

   1.Pre-insert or pre-update validation: Before inserting or updating a record in the "Product" table, your application could check whether the specified category exists in the "Product_Category" table. If the category does not exist, the operation would be rejected, and an error message would be returned to the user.
    2.Stored procedures or triggers: You can create stored procedures or triggers in your database that enforce data integrity rules. For example, you could create an insert or update trigger on the "Product" table that verifies whether the specified category exists in the "Product_Category" table. If not, the operation would be rolled back, preventing the invalid data from being inserted or updated.
    3.Application-level validation: Implement validation logic in your application code to ensure that each product record includes a valid category ID. This could involve performing a lookup against the "Product_Category" table before inserting or updating a product record.
